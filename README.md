# Not Game Stop E-Commerce Site
This is an ecommerce site specifically for gamers. Gamers can post their games for sell at the price they want. They can start an auction or sell it at a flat rate. The inspiration came from always being ripped off from Game Stop from selling and buying used games.

## Getting Started
Link to Site: [Not-Game-Stop](https://not-game-stop.herokuapp.com/)

How it works: 
A user can browse the products on the page but must be logged in to purchase. They can log in with google account. Once logged in they are able to purchase products and post products for sale. They can leave reviews on sellers pages and leave reviews for products. They can also particiapte in auctions posted by users. User with the highest bid after a time period can be awarded the product by the seller. If the product is not claimed the seller can restart the aution. 

## Next Steps
Next steps are to clean up the UI and UX. Users should be able to see a live count of their auctions. More robust styling and using third party api's to process payments. Also community forums and message boards would be good additions.
